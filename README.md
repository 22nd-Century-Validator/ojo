> A Golang Implementation of the Ojo Network, a cosmos-first oracle
> with DeFi safety in mind.

Ojo is an oracle platform which other blockchains and smart contracts can use to receive
up-to-date and accurate data. This platform arose from our work at
[Umee](https://github.com/umee-network/umee), where we worked on developing our
own oracle based off of the [Terra Classic](https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core) design.
Now, we specalize bringing the lessons we've learned to the greater Cosmos.
